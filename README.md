# A_project_based_on_sentimental_analysis
This is a project based on sentimental analysis and my study is using Twitter data set for the same. 
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. 
The omnipresence of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they are observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically
monitoring Twitter (i.e., disaster relief organizations and news agencies). 
Therefore, in this task I am prediction whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. 
If so, 
predict a 1. 
Otherwise, predict a 0.
